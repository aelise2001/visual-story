    4460 Baychester Ave, home to a Christian center, a tax service, and not one but two tattoo artists. One of them, Black Version Tattoo, marked by a single business card and the call of Caribbean music amongst the sounds of worship, is still finding footing in the aftermath of the pandemic. Run by Black Version himself, the tattoo shop is located off the last stop of the 2 train, hidden in plain sight. Despite this, business is good, and in an ever-changing world, Version remarked that in his 14 years of living in the Bronx, it’s the people that change, not the place, saying, “You know, it's a different generation, social media has a lot of exposure and just people trying new things.”

    After coming from Jamaica at 18 with no absolute path, Version’s life has been all about trying new things, with him saying, “It's an experience. Back home, you're only seeing like movies and, you know, videos of America.  But they only show you the exciting, nice part of America. Until you come here and life really hits, you know. It's not so easy as they show it on TV.” And for him, tattooing wasn’t always the end goal.

              The Birth of Black Version
          </h2>

      </center>
    <p>
    
        “Never really thought to become a tattoo artist until... It was this one day I wanted a tattoo, and it was so expensive I couldn't afford it.  So I go online and type in tattoo equipment. The price was so reasonable. Didn't make any sense to me why the tattoo was so expensive, but the tattoo machine itself was so cheap. So, I started doing tattoos for free in the beginning.  People keep writing me and asking me how much I charge for tattoos. At that time, I was, like, free. They didn't believe me, so they keep asking me the same thing; I just give them a random price.  And that was reasonable for them. So this tattoo artist see my potential and start telling me, start encouraging me to do more in the tattoo business.” Thus Black Version was born. A name that Version is known by in the community except with his four-year-old son, who simply calls him dad. 

    
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the years, Black Version understands the value of having a wealth of experience. “By doing tattoos for a long period of time, I realized it's not the product itself; it's the work you put in and the experience.  So, you're really not paying for the tattoo. You're paying for the experience.”

        <p>
            In a community of mostly Black people, Black Version is one of few tattoo artists who knows their way around tattooing on darker skin tones, with Version himself saying, “There's a lot of dark people that want to get some color. And there is tattoo artists that don't care; they just want to get the money. Because in one second, the tattoo will look really nice when it's just done.  But after it heals, it don't look the same. Some tattoo artists are really selfish; they don't tell you.  Because they want the money. Sometimes, the pigment of your skin just comes right back in. It's like getting a bruise.  When you get that bruise, and you got a scab, when the scab come off, your pigment white, and the tattoo will look bright then because a tattoo is basically like a bruise, your tattoo will look bright until your complexion come right back in, and the tattoo just gets darker.”

However, his specialty is more than just tattooing on darker complexions. Black Version is passionate about taking something scarred and making it beautiful. Saying this about his most frequently done tattoo, “Especially, like, the tummy tuck scars…they have that long scar across, and they just need a tattoo to cover it. That's one of my specialties right there.” continuing to say, “The idea is to do something that's distracting from the scar itself. So, it just creates an illusion, so a person doesn't pay attention to the scar itself. So whatever you're doing, you have to do it really big, depending on what it is. If it's like a name, you don't have to do it big. But if it's a scar, you want to do it big. Because if you do it small, you're only targeting the scar. Now, people get to see the scar.  When I do it big, you’re not gonna focus on the scar. You focus on the tattoo.”

            Tattooing isn’t the only place he finds solace. As an avid motorcycle enthusiast, Version has an affinity for the open road, saying, “I've been riding a motorcycle for three years before. This is my fourth. It feels way more peaceful when you actually have a motorcycle. Life is just so; there's no restriction. You know, unless you fall off the bike, that's it. …I feel free, feel untouchable. There's no rule apply when you actually have a superbike. The only rule is don't fall.  That's it. That's the only little peace I have. That and my son. He's four. Yeah, he's everything."
